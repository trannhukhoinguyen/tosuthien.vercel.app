Guishan turned the stick around in his hand, blew on it three times, and handed it back to Baizhang. Baizhang accepted the stick.

The only ideology Mujū disapproved of was intolerance, and he "was himself aware of, and intrigued by, the paradox of the position". (Morrell 1985:19) He was disdainful of contemporaries such as Nichiren Shonin who denounced all practices but their own, and he accepted all schools of Buddhism as having a useful teaching, writing in the preface to Shasekishū that "when a man who practices one version of the Way of Buddha vilifies another because it differs from his own sect, he cannot avoid the sin of slandering the Law."

      Although it no longer exists as a religious organization, Fuke Zen's following during the feudal period was quite extensive.
      Its members could be easily recognized by their practice playing the shakuhachi flute, which was considered a form of meditation and was called suizen (吹禪).
      These musician-monks were known at first as komosō (薦僧; literally "straw-mat monks") and, by the mid-1600s, as komusō (虚無僧; literally "emptiness monk").]

      In the Jingde Chuandenglu:
      When Sanping first called on Shigong Huicang when Shigong saw him coming he went through the motions of bending back a bow and said, "Look, an arrow."
      Sanping bared his chest and said, "This is the arrow that kills. What is the arrow that gives life?"
      Shigong plucked the bowstring three times upon which Sanping bowed.

The Zhaolun (Chao-lun) is an important early Chinese Buddhist collection of essays which presented time, sunyata, prajna, and nirvana in the context of native, Taoist-inspired terminology. Shitou Xiqian was inspired to compose the Sandokai: Meeting of Ultimate and Relative while reading the Zhaolun. He also wrote a commentary on the Vimalakirti sutra. He is mentioned in Blue Cliff Records 40. See Without Difficulty, Studying the Mystery, and Denkoroku: Record of the Transmission of Luminosity. From the Zhaolun:
      The true nature of dharmas is that they are neither in motion, nor at rest. Or, to put it differently: they are both in motion and in rest. To use the formulation of the Middle Way: by stating that there is both motion and rest, we fall into one of the two extremes. By stating that there is neither motion nor rest, we follow the Middle Way."
      "All dharmas are truly non-existent in one sense and not non-existent in another sense. In the first point of view they are although apparently existing, actually non-existing. In the second point of view they are although apparently non-existing, actually not non-existing."
      "Thus the sage is as a hollow void. He cherishes no-knowledge. He remains in this world of impermanence and activities; however he abides in the realm of non-action (wu-wei). He is situated within the walls of what is expressible, and yet he lives in the open space that transcends all speech. He is silent and alone, empty and open; his form of existence cannot be covered in words. There remains nothing further to be said about him.

He was accepted as a student by Huineng in 713. After Huineng died, we know very little about what happened next until he was ordained at Lofu-shan in 728, after which he went to study with Qingyuan in Zhihzhou. He studied with Qingyuan for twelve years and then, in 742, Xiqian went to Nanyue where he built a hermitage for himself on top of a large flat rock east of the Nan-zi temple. Thus people called him "Shitou Hoshang," "cliff-edge monk" or, more colourfully, "Stone-head."
      In 764 he went to Liangduan where he and his his monastery had a great deal of interaction with another famous Zen master Jiangxi Mazu Daoyi (Chiang-hsi Ma-tsu Tao-i, Baso Doitsu) 709-788. The Jingde Chuandeng-lu says of these two, "West of the (Jiangxi) river the great solitary one (Mazu) is the master and south of the lake (Hunan) Cliff-edge (Shihtou) is the master. Whoever has not met these two great masters is ignorant of Zen."
      Three of the early five Zen Houses or streams stem from Shihtou; as well as Yaoshan Weiyan, from whom sprang the Caodong-zong (Soto), his many Dharma-heirs include Tianhuang Daowu (T'ien-huang Tao-wu, Tenno Dogo),748-807, from whose heirs the Fayen-zong (Hogen) and Yunmen-zong (Ummon) originated.

Few really face this problem, and it is not at all easy to settle. Face it directly without hesitation, for how else can liberation come?"

A major character in Rhythm and Song. The Jingde Chuandenglu says: "Amongst all of Dongshan's students Guangren had a natural power in displaying the innermost mystery.

The tenzo from Jiashan who was travelling from temple to temple, happened to get snowed in there and so he listened in on the lecture. Daiyuan Fu was explaining the section on the three factors of Buddha Nature and the three virtues of the Dharmakaya when, in the midst of the explanation of the subtleties of the Dharmakaya, the tenzo burst out laughing. After the lecture Daiyuan Fu asked the tenzo to his room where he said, "Look, I'm really a very simple person and so the comments I make when I lecture on the sutras are just literal explanations. I noticed that you couldn't help laughing about what I said about the Dharmakaya. Could you be so kind as to point out where I went off?" The tenzo said, "Well, you were saying just what was written down there, and so it's not that it is wrong. It's just that you didn't know what you were saying." So after this Daiyuan Fu ceased any further lectures and began to visit many masters, inquiring of the Buddha Dharma, exerting himself in practice.
