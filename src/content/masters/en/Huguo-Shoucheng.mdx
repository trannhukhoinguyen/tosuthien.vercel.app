    ### Speech Recordings

    The __Wudeng Huiyuan__ provides a glimpse of this teacher’s style.
    __Huguo (Jingguo)__ entered the hall and addressed the monks, saying:

    > All the great masters in every quarter, in all circumstances, have ascended the lecture platform for the sake of people.
    And whenever anyone has asked them the meaning of Bodhidharma’s coming from the west, not one of them has directly spoken the answer.

    A monk then said, “I ask the master to answer this question.”

    __Huguo (Jingguo)__ said, “A Hebei ass brays. A Henan dog barks.”

    The monk asked, “What is Buddha?”

    __Huguo (Jingguo)__ uttered in disgust, “You ass!”

    ***

    A monk asked, “If someone for whom the great vast earth is but one eye comes
    forth, then what?”

    __Huguo (Jingguo)__ said, “A low-class fellow.”

    A monk asked, “Who is it that walks in the place where all the buddhas can’t
    go?”

    __Huguo (Jingguo)__ said, “Blockhead!”

    A monk asked, “Why did Bodhidharma come from the west?”

    __Huguo (Jingguo)__ said, “When one person says it, it’s a rumor. When a thousand say it,
    it’s a fact.”

    A monk asked, “When a white crane sits in the pine tree, what is it?”

    __Huguo (Jingguo)__ said, “An embarrassment on the ground.”

    A monk asked, “During the era of the Hui Chang suppression, where were the
    good guardian deities?”

    __Huguo (Jingguo)__ said, “An embarrassment in front of the temple gate.”

    A monk asked, “What is it when dripping water turns into ice?”

    __Huguo (Jingguo)__ said, “An embarrassment when the sun comes out.”
