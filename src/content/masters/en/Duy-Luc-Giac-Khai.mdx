  ### Introduction

  <Indent/>Born in May 5, 1923 in China, and passed away in January 7,
  2000 in the United States, he left a dharma heritage that has
  influenced and thrived in Vietnam and in many other
  countries. He had the birth name La Du and another dharma
  name Giac Khai. When he finished elementary school at 16,
  his father took him to emigrate to Can Tho, Vietnam, where
  he studied by himself and ten years later obtained a teacher
  degree in teaching Chinese.

  <Indent/>From 1948, he was invited to teach for ten years at several
  elementary schools – first at a school in Ta Keo Province,
  Cambodia, then at Khai Tri Elementary School in Can Tho
  and at Cai Von Elementary School in Vinh Long, Vietnam.

  <Indent/>In 1958, after obtaining an Oriental medicine degree, he
  was invited to work as a doctor of traditional medicine
  and provide free medical services to poor patients at the
  Te Nguon Duong Ca Mau clinic and the Minh Nguyet Cu
  Si Lam, a Buddhist association in Can Tho, for eight
  years.

  <Indent/>When he found in the library of Cu Si Lam the Kinh Tuc
  Tang, a set of 150 books on Buddhism, he tried to read
  all them. One year later, he finished reading just seven
  books; hence he decided that he would read only the Zen
  books. At the time, he was also learning the Patriarch
  Zen from Dharma Master Dieu Duyen, who had had
  many years of following closely Zen Masters Hu Van and
  Lai Qua. Dieu Duyen later died in 1976 at the Thao
  Duong Temple, Vietnam.

  <Indent/>In February 8, 1973, he was received by Venerable
  Hoang Tu into the Tu An Temple, Cho Lon, to live as a
  novice monk.
  In May 1974, he received the full monastic codes of a
  Bhiksu in an ordination ceremony at the Cuc Lac Temple,
  Malaysia.

  <Indent/>Since then, he meditated tirelessly on the huatou “Who I
  was before the existence of heaven and earth?” for many
  years.

  <Indent/>One day, while reading the book “Discourse on
  Madhyamika,” he saw the sentence “Because of
  emptiness, all things are done,” and suddenly understood
  the meaning of “From emptiness, the activity appears.”
  He then understood that the emptiness was born from
  the great wisdom; that, according to the Shurangama
  Sutra (Shoulengyan Jing), countless worldly countries
  were born from the emptiness just like a mountain of
  bubbles arised from the ocean; that the Sixth Patriarch’s
  saying “Clinging to nothing must be the core of your
  thinking” had the same direction as Vimalakirti’s saying
  “From the non-abiding base, establish all things”; that the
  non-abiding meant the nature of emptiness; that the True
  Suchness was originally emptiness, but it flowed out all
  activity; that the nature and activity of all Buddhas were
  the same as those of sentient beings, spreading all over
  time and space; and that every sentient being,
  unknowingly, was using the activity of their Buddha
  nature.

  <Indent/>In April 2, 1977, obeying the order of his patron master,
  Venerable Hoang Tu, Zen Master Duy Luc started
  teaching the Patriarch Zen at Tu An Temple, Ho Chi Minh
  City. Within two years, thousands from the four groups of
  Buddhists came to him to learn; it was estimated that
  over 4,000 Buddhists practiced Zen under his guidance,
  and every Zen retreat had average over 300 participants.


  <Indent/>In February 1989, he emigrated to the U.S., and founded
  Tu An Zen Temple in Orange County, California.
  Practitioners coming to study Zen under his guidance
  were Westerners and Asians, in which mostly were
  Vietnamese and Chinese. He was also invited to teach
  the Patriarch Zen in other Zen centers in America, and in
  many other countries – frequently at Chanh Giac Temple
  in Toronto, Canada; Dai Bi Temple in Taiwan; Quan Am
  Temple in Brisbane, Australia; and in Hong Kong.

  <Indent/>Especially, Zen Master Duy Luc responded warmly to
  any invitation from the temples in Vietnam when possible.
  He conducted many Zen retreats in Ho Chi Minh City,
  mostly at Tu An Temple in District 5, Hung Phuoc Temple
  in District 3, Phap Thanh Temple and Sung Duc Temple
  in District 6, and Hue Quang Temple in Tan Binh District;
  in the Ba Ria Vung Tau Province, mostly at Dai Tong
  Lam Temple and Thien Hoa Nunnery; and in many
  temples in the provinces of Long An, Soc Trang, Tay
  Ninh, Khanh Hoa and Binh Dinh.

  <Indent/>In 1996, Zen Master Duy Luc founded a Zen farm in Cu Chi,
  Saigon, where he and his students grew organic vegetables
  (i.e., without fertilizer and pesticide).

  <Indent/>In 1998, he was invited by the Vietnam Buddhist Church
  (VBC) to be a member of the Central Buddhist Education
  Committee. He accepted the VBC’s request, and taught
  at the short-term expanded education courses in Binh
  Dinh, where learners came from the central provinces,
  and at the second central office of the VBC, where
  learners came from Saigon and from the southern and
  eastern provinces.

  <Indent/>In 1999, he founded a medical clinic in Long Thanh
  District, Dong Nai Province, gave free treatment and
  medicine to patients, and circumstantially expounded the
  Zen teachings.

  <Indent/>He wrote, translated from Chinese into Vietnamese, and
  penned his own commentaries on dozens of Buddhist
  scriptures and Zen classics. The circulation of his books,
  mostly in Vietnamese and some in Chinese, was
  estimated at about tens of thousand copies in print in
  Vietnam.

  <Indent/>The books authored by Zen Master Duy Luc included

  Words of Buddha and Patriarchs), Công An Của Phật
