    ### Introduction

    Master __Jiufeng Daoqian__ (? - 923) was a disciple of __Shishuang Qingzhu__. He came from ancient Fuzhou.

    Until __Shishuang__’s death, __Jiufeng__ served as his student and personal attendant.
    At the invitation of the other monks __Jiufeng__ then assumed the vacant abbacy of the monastery.

    Later he moved to __Jiufeng__ (“Nine Peaks”) in Ruizhou (near modern Gao’an in Jiangxi Province), where he acquired his mountain name.
    During his later years he lived first at Shimen, where he had many students, and finally at Letan.

    ### Speech Recordings

    📀 __Jiufeng__ served as __Shishuang__’s attendant. When __Shishuang__ passed away, the congregation invited the head monk to become abbot.
    __Jiufeng__ said to the congregation,

    “First, he must show that he understood our late master’s great meaning, then he can become abbot.”

    The head monk said, “What teaching do you mean?”

    📀 J__Jiufeng__ said,

    - _“Our late teacher said,_

    > Desist! Become barren autumn ground! Have one thought for ten thousand years. Be a cold dead tree. Be an ancient incense dish.
    Be a blank strip of white silk.’

    _Not asking about the rest, what is a ‘strip of white silk’?”_

    The head monk said, “This teaching illuminates a matter of form”

    📀 __Jiufeng__ said,

    - _“Fundamentally, you don’t comprehend our late teacher’s meaning”_

    The monk said, “You don’t approve of my answer? Then light a stick of incense, and if I don’t go before it is burned up, then you can say I don’t understand our late master’s meaning.”

    A stick of incense was then lit, but before it burned down, the head monk died.

    📀 __Jiufeng__ patted the head monk’s body on the back and said,

    > Dying while sitting or passing away while standing isn’t it. You didn’t see our late master’s meaning even in your dreams.

    After he became abbot, a monk asked, “On what path are those who do not adhere to the nine paths [that cut off defilement]?”

    📀 J__Jiufeng__ said,

    - _“The path of beasts”_

    The monk said, “Then what path is it that beasts travel?”

    📀 J__Jiufeng__ said,

    - _“Not the nine paths”_

    The monk said, “On that path there are many transmigrations before one becomes a person”

    📀 J__Jiufeng__ said,

    - _“You should understand that there are those without a common life”_

    The monks said, “What life is it that isn’t common?”

    📀 J__Jiufeng__ said,

    > Immortality with the breath ceasing. Have you all gained an understanding of life?
    You should want to know about it.
    A flowing spring is life. Profound solitude is the body.
    The thousand surging waves are Manjushri’s condition. The revolving empty firmament is Samantabhadra’s bed.
    >
    > Or next time I explain it, I may borrow a phrase and say it’s pointing at the moon.
    When you meet daily affairs it’s talking about the moon. When from the gate of our ancestors you meet daily affairs it’s as if you’re employing the banner of truth in each moment.
    >
    > Or it’s the transcendent virtue that comes before the ordered creation of myriad names in all realms.
    Brothers, what body and speech bind you? It’s right here.
    I’m not deceiving you an inch. Examine my words and you’ll see.
    I don’t deceive your ears. Test my words. I don’t deceive your eyes.
    Sort it out and see it clearly.
    >
    > Thus, what precedes the sound of words can’t be avoided. What follows words can’t be stored away.
    All of heaven and earth come forth from your own body.
    >
    > So where would you go to gain peace for the eyes, the ears, the nose, and the tongue?
    If you try to realize it by delving beneath the root of meaning, then through an endless future you will never have a bit of rest.
    The unending future meets us without rest.
    >
    > Therefore the ancients said, ‘Trying to use your mind to study the great mystery, you seem to face the west, but you’re traveling east'.

    Zen master Jiufeng Daoqian [Dajue] was once asked by a monastic, "I heard that you said that one who transmits words is outstanding among the sages. Is it true?"

    📀 Jiufeng said,

    - _"That's right"_

    The monastic said, "Sakyamuni emerged in this world, pointed to heaven and earth, and said, 'Above earth and under heaven, I alone am venerable.' How can you call him one who transmits words?"

    📀 Jiufeng said,

    - _"I call him one who transmits words because he pointed to heaven and earth"_
