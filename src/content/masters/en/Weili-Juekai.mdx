    ### Introduction

    <Youtube client:load id="" title="" />

    Born in May 5, 1923 in China, and passed away in January 7,
    2000 in the United States, he left a dharma heritage that has
    influenced and thrived in Vietnam and in many other
    countries. He had the birth name La Du and another dharma
    name Giac Khai. When he finished elementary school at 16,
    his father took him to emigrate to Can Tho, Vietnam, where
    he studied by himself and ten years later obtained a teacher
    degree in teaching Chinese.

    From 1948, he was invited to teach for ten years at several
    elementary schools – first at a school in Ta Keo Province,
    Cambodia, then at Khai Tri Elementary School in Can Tho
    and at Cai Von Elementary School in Vinh Long, Vietnam.

    In 1958, after obtaining an Oriental medicine degree, he
    was invited to work as a doctor of traditional medicine
    and provide free medical services to poor patients at the
    Te Nguon Duong Ca Mau clinic and the Minh Nguyet Cu
    Si Lam, a Buddhist association in Can Tho, for eight
    years.

    When he found in the library of Cu Si Lam the Kinh Tuc
    Tang, a set of 150 books on Buddhism, he tried to read
    all them. One year later, he finished reading just seven
    books; hence he decided that he would read only the Zen
    books. At the time, he was also learning the Patriarch
    Zen from Dharma Master Dieu Duyen, who had had
    many years of following closely Zen Masters Hu Van and
    Lai Qua. Dieu Duyen later died in 1976 at the Thao
    Duong Temple, Vietnam.

    In February 8, 1973, he was received by Venerable
    Hoang Tu into the Tu An Temple, Cho Lon, to live as a
    novice monk.
    In May 1974, he received the full monastic codes of a
    Bhiksu in an ordination ceremony at the Cuc Lac Temple,
    Malaysia.

    Since then, he meditated tirelessly on the huatou “Who I
    was before the existence of heaven and earth?” for many
    years.

    One day, while reading the book “Discourse on
    Madhyamika,” he saw the sentence “Because of
    emptiness, all things are done,” and suddenly understood
    the meaning of “From emptiness, the activity appears.”
    He then understood that the emptiness was born from
    the great wisdom; that, according to the Shurangama
    Sutra (Shoulengyan Jing), countless worldly countries
    were born from the emptiness just like a mountain of
    bubbles arised from the ocean; that the Sixth Patriarch’s
    saying “Clinging to nothing must be the core of your
    thinking” had the same direction as Vimalakirti’s saying
    “From the non-abiding base, establish all things”; that the
    non-abiding meant the nature of emptiness; that the True
    Suchness was originally emptiness, but it flowed out all
    activity; that the nature and activity of all Buddhas were
    the same as those of sentient beings, spreading all over
    time and space; and that every sentient being,
    unknowingly, was using the activity of their Buddha
    nature.

    In April 2, 1977, obeying the order of his patron master,
    Venerable Hoang Tu, Zen Master Duy Luc started
    teaching the Patriarch Zen at Tu An Temple, Ho Chi Minh
    City. Within two years, thousands from the four groups of
    Buddhists came to him to learn; it was estimated that
    over 4,000 Buddhists practiced Zen under his guidance,
    and every Zen retreat had average over 300 participants.


    In February 1989, he emigrated to the U.S., and founded
    Tu An Zen Temple in Orange County, California.
    Practitioners coming to study Zen under his guidance
    were Westerners and Asians, in which mostly were
    Vietnamese and Chinese. He was also invited to teach
    the Patriarch Zen in other Zen centers in America, and in
    many other countries – frequently at Chanh Giac Temple
    in Toronto, Canada; Dai Bi Temple in Taiwan; Quan Am
    Temple in Brisbane, Australia; and in Hong Kong.

    Especially, Zen Master Duy Luc responded warmly to
    any invitation from the temples in Vietnam when possible.
    He conducted many Zen retreats in Ho Chi Minh City,
    mostly at Tu An Temple in District 5, Hung Phuoc Temple
    in District 3, Phap Thanh Temple and Sung Duc Temple
    in District 6, and Hue Quang Temple in Tan Binh District;
    in the Ba Ria Vung Tau Province, mostly at Dai Tong
    Lam Temple and Thien Hoa Nunnery; and in many
    temples in the provinces of Long An, Soc Trang, Tay
    Ninh, Khanh Hoa and Binh Dinh.

    In 1996, Zen Master Duy Luc founded a Zen farm in Cu Chi,
    Saigon, where he and his students grew organic vegetables
    (i.e., without fertilizer and pesticide).

    In 1998, he was invited by the Vietnam Buddhist Church
    (VBC) to be a member of the Central Buddhist Education
    Committee. He accepted the VBC’s request, and taught
    at the short-term expanded education courses in Binh
    Dinh, where learners came from the central provinces,
    and at the second central office of the VBC, where
    learners came from Saigon and from the southern and
    eastern provinces.

    In 1999, he founded a medical clinic in Long Thanh
    District, Dong Nai Province, gave free treatment and
    medicine to patients, and circumstantially expounded the
    Zen teachings.

    He wrote, translated from Chinese into Vietnamese, and
    penned his own commentaries on dozens of Buddhist
    scriptures and Zen classics. The circulation of his books,
    mostly in Vietnamese and some in Chinese, was
    estimated at about tens of thousand copies in print in
    Vietnam.

    The books authored by Zen Master Duy Luc included
    Góp Nhặt Lời Phật Tổ và Thánh Hiền (A Collection of the
