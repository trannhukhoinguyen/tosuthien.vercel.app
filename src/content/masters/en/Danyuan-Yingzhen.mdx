  ### Story & Speech Recordings

    <Indent/>When Zen master Yingzhen of Danyuan Mountain in Qizhou served as attendant for National Teacher Huizhong,
    one day the National Teacher sat on the meditation platform in the Dharma hall.
    When Danyuan came in, the National Teacher put down one foot. When Danyuan saw this he immediately went out again.
    After a while he came back into the hall.

    The National Teacher said, _“What was that about when you came in a while ago?”_

    Danyuan said, _“To whom do you speak of it?”_

    The National Teacher said, _“I am asking you”_

    Danyuan said, _“Where did you see me?”_

    On another day Danyuan carried a bamboo basket into the abbot’s room.

    The National Teacher asked, _“What are you carrying in the basket?”_

    Danyuan said, _“Green plums”_

    The National Teacher said, _“Why did you bring them?”_

    Danyuan said, _“To provide you support”_

    The National Teacher said, _“What good are they if they’re green?”_

    Danyuan said, _“I just give them as an offering”_

    The National Teacher said, _“Buddha doesn’t accept support”_

    Danyuan said, _“When I do something like this, why do you act in this manner?”_

    The National Teacher said, _“I don’t give support”_

    Danyuan said, _“Why not?”_

    The National Teacher said, _“I don’t have any fruit”_

    Mayu asked Danyuan, _“Is the twelve-faced Kwan Yin holy or not?”_

    Danyuan said, _“Yes”_

    Mayu then slapped Danyuan’s ears.Danyuan said, _“I didn’t imagine that you’d reached this state”_

    On the anniversary of the death of the National Teacher, Danyuan held a memorial banquet.

    A monk asked, _“Is the National Teacher coming?”_

    Danyuan said, _“We won’t have his mind”_

    The monk asked, _“Then why give this banquet?”_

    Danyuan said, _“To not stop the truth of the world”_
