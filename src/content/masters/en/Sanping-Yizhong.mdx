    ### Introduction

    <Indent/>Sanping Yizhong 三平義忠 (781-872) (Jingde chuandenglu T. 2076, 248b11-c26):
    Chan master Sanping Yizhong of Zhangzhou was a native of Fuzhou.
    His family name was Yang. He first studied with Shigong. Shigong always awaited students with a fully drawn bow and arrow. Master [Sanping] pointed at the dharma chair.
    Shigong said: “Look at this arrow!” Sanping bared his chest and said: “This is an arrow to kill a man. What about an arrow to enliven a man? Shigong snapped the string of his bow three times. Sanping prostrated. Shigong said: “Thirty years, one drawn bow and a pair of arrows: thankfully I now got myself half a sage.” Then he broke his bow and arrows.
    漳州三平義忠禪師福州人也。姓楊氏。初參石鞏。 石鞏常張弓架箭以待學徒。 師詣法席。鞏曰。看箭。師乃撥開胸云。此是殺人箭。活人箭又作麼生。鞏乃扣弓絃三下。師便作禮。鞏云。三十年一張弓兩隻箭。只謝得半箇聖人。遂拗折弓箭。

    Master Sanping Yizhong (781-872) was a disciple of Master Dadian Baotong who taught in Shaozhou in the far south (near Caoxi).
    Master Dadian had been one of the prominent students of Master Shitou.

    After training with Master Dadian, the young Yizhong traveled to refine himself among many teachers.
    Once he visited Master Shigong Huizang, the disciple of Mazu who had been a hunter before becoming a monk.  Master Shigong had a fierce reputation and was known to greet his visitors by aiming a bow and arrow at them.  When Yizhong arrived before the master, he was greeted in this way. As  the master drew back his arrow,  Yizhong opened his robe, bared his chest, and said, “This arrow is for killing.  What arrow gives life?”

    Shigong lowered the bow and arrow.  Yizhong made prostrations.  Master Shigong then said, “After thirty years I've finally met half a sage.”  Then he broke his bow.

    Yizhong eventually settled down to teach at Triple Peace (Sanping) Mountain in Zhangzhou (in modern Fujian Province).  Once he said to his community, “Just this very seeing and hearing goes beyond 'seeing and hearing', and there are no other sounds or forms to offer you.  If you realize this right here, then nothing will be the matter.”
