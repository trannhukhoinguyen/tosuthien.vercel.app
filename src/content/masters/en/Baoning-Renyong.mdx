    ### Introduction

    BAONING RENYONG (n.d.) was a disciple of Yangqi Fanghui.
    He came from Siming (a place now in Zhejiang Province).
    As a young man he possessed a remarkably dignified appearance as well as extraordinary intelligence.
    He excelled at the study of Tiantai Buddhism.
    He later studied under the great Yunmen lineage teacher Xuedou Chongxian.
    Xuedou recognized the young man’s wonderful potential as a vessel for the Dharma, but offended Baoning by addressing him with a title akin to the English phrase “academic schoolmaster.”
    Baoning left Xuedou’s mountain with the vow, “_I will continue in this life to travel on a pilgrimage to study Zen, and if I don’t find a teacher who surpasses Xuedou, I vow to never return home._”
    Baoning traveled until he came to Yangqi Fanghui’s temple on Mt. Yungai.
    It is recorded that at their first meeting, Yangqi did not complete even a single sentence before Baoning attained the “mind-seal of illuminated awakening” (complete enlightenment).
    After spending time at Mt. Yungai, Yangqi died, and Baoning set off to travel extensively with his Dharma brother and close friend Baiyun Shouduan.
    Eventually he settled and taught at the Baoning Temple at Jinling.
    Zen master Baoning Renyong entered the hall to address the monks.
    The attendant lit incense [to present to the Buddha].

    Baoning pointed to the attendant and said, “_The attendant has already expounded the Dharma for all of you!_”
    Baoning addressed the monks, saying, “_For more than twenty years I carried a pack and bowl, traveling everywhere within the four seas, studying with more than ten different Zen adepts.
    However, I never caught a glimpse of my own house, and I was just like a senseless stone.
    All the worthies I practiced with couldn’t provide me a single positive benefit. During that entire time I did not learn a thing.
    However, fortunately, my pitiable life was suddenly blown by the karmic winds into Jiangning, where, jostled by the crowd, I was pushed into an old run-down temple on a busy intersection.
    There, I just served as a ‘porridge vendor,’ receiving and helping everyone who came along. My duties never let up.
    There was sufficient salt and vinegar and there was enough gruel and rice.
    I passed some time in this fashion. I previously never imagined, even in a dream, that I would realize the Buddhadharma in this way._”

    Baoning addressed the monks, saying, “_Look! Look! I’ve fallen into ‘Plucking Tongue Hell’ [a hell where persons who have spoken deceptively have their tongues yanked out]!_”

    Baoning then pinched his own tongue and cried out, “_Aiya! Aiya!_”

    Baoning said, “_There’s no Maitreya Buddha up in heaven and there’s no Maitreya Buddha in the earth.
    Why is it that even if you bust open emptiness you still can’t find him?_”

    Baoning then hung a foot down off of his seat and said, “_Everyone! Where are you going?_”

    Baoning said,

    > “If you say that the Buddhadharma supports all beings, you won’t avoid having your eyebrows fall out.
    If you say that the worldly dharmas support all beings, you shoot straight into hell like an arrow.
    However, aside from these two ways of speaking, what can I say today? There’s no use for the three-inch tongue.
    The two empty hands can’t make a fist!”

    A monk asked Baoning Renyong, “_What is Buddha?_”
    Baoning said, “_Add wood to the fire._”
    The monk asked, “_What is the Way?_”
    Baoning said, “_There are thorns in the mud._”
    The monk asked, “_Who are people of the Way?_”
    Baoning said, “_Those that hate walking there._”
    A monk asked, “_An old worthy said, Though the cold wind withers the leaves, it is still a joy when an ancient returns. Who is an ancient?_”
    Baoning said, “_Master Yangqi is long gone._”
    The monk said, “_Right here and now, is there someone who can comprehend this?_”
    Baoning said, “_The eyeless old villager secretly taps his head._”
    A monk asked, “_What is Buddha?_”
    Baoning said, “_You’re not aware of the stink of your own shit._”

    Baoning recited a verse to the monks:

    > A cold autumn wind.
    >
    > The wind drones in the pines.
    >
    > The wayward traveler
    >
    > Thinks of his home.

    Then Baoning said, “_Who do you say is the traveler? Where is his home?_”
    A monk asked, “_What is Baoning’s domain?_”
    Baoning said, “_The king of the mountain falls down._”
    The monk asked, “_What is a person in Baoning’s domain?_”
    Baoning said, “_One can’t have a single nostril._”
    A monk asked, “_What is Buddha?_”
    Baoning said, “_An iron mallet with no holes._”
    The monk then asked, “_What is the great meaning of the Buddhadharma?_”
    Baoning said, “_A hot soup pot has no cold place._”
    A monk asked, “_Lingshan pointed to the moon. The Sixth Ancestor spoke of the moon. However, I, as yet, don’t know what is beneath Baoning’s gate._”
    Baoning yelled, “_Ah!_”
    The monk said, “_There are flowers stuck to your face._” Baoning shouted.
    The monk asked, “_I don’t ask about picking leaves or seeking branches. I just ask, ‘What is it that directly cuts off the source root?’_”
    Baoning said, “_A mosquito on an iron ox._”
    The monk said, “_For those who are clear about cutting off the source, how do you point out the flow?_”
    Baoning said, “_The stone man’s back streams with sweat._”
