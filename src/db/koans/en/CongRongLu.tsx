      'Closing the door and sleeping is the way to receive those of highest potential; looking, reflecting, and stretching is a roundabout way for the middling and lesser.

      'Before you people come to this teaching hall and before I leave my room, when will you attain realization? This is already falling into three and four. Haven’t you read Xuedou’s saying, " If there had been someone there who could understand the multiplicity of meanings according to situations, as in the Sanskrit word saindhava, what would have been the need for Manjusri to strike a beat?" When you bring it up to careful examination, Xuedou shouldn’t ask for salt (saindhava)--how could I present a horse (saindhava)? Even Manjusri, the ancestral teacher of seven Buddhas of antiquity, saying, "Clearly observe the Dharma of the King of Dharma; the Dharma of the King of Dharma is thus," still needs to pull the nails out of his eyes and wrench the wedges out of the back of his brain before he will realize it. Even up till now at the conclusion of the opening of the teaching hall we strike the gavel on the sounding board and say, " Clearly observe the Dharma of the King of Dharma; the Dharma of the King of Dharma is thus," bringing up this precedent. The World Honored One immediately got down from the seat at that; he saved a half, and imparted a half to Tiantong, / ' +

      'Tiantong says, "The unique breeze of reality--do you see?" Is it the World Honored One’s ascending the seat that is the unique breeze of reality? ' +
      'Is Tiantong’s reciting his verse the unique breeze of reality? Is my further inquiry the unique breeze of reality? This way it’s become three levels--what is the unique breeze of reality? Indeed, you people each have a share, but you should investigate it thoroughly. He also says, "Continously creation runs her loom and shuttle". / ' +
      'Mother of evolution and Creator are different names for the creation of beings. / ' +
      'Confucianism and Taoism are based on one energy; The Buddhist tradition is based on one mind. Guifeng said that the original energy still is created by mind and is all contained in the imagery field of the repository consciousness. I, Wansong, say this is the very source of the Caodong School, the lifeline of the Buddhas and Patriarchs. / ' +
      'As the woof goes through the warp, the weave is dense and fine; a continuous thread comes from the shuttle, making every detail--how could this be even spoken of on the same day as false cause or no cause?

      'Although this is like insects living on wood happening to make patterns, nevertheless though he makes his cart behind closed doors, when he brings it out it fits in the grooves. / ' +
      'Finally, to Manjusri, he gives a cutting putdown, retorting, "Nothing can be done about Manjusri’s leaking." Manjusri struck the gavel and the World Honored One thereupon got down from the platform; when Kasyapa struck a gavel, a billion Manjusris appeared--all are this same kind of situation; why are gathering in and letting go not the same? You tell me, where is it that Manjusri has leaked? Carefully to open the spice tree buds, He lets out the free spring on the branches. / ',

    intro:
      'A man presented a jewel three times but didn’t escape punishment. When a luminous jewel is thrown to anyone, few do not draw their sword. For an impromptu guest there is no impromptu host; what’s appropriate provisionally is not appropriate for the real. If unusual treasures and rare jewels cannot be put to use, I’ll bring out the head of a dead cat--look!',
    main:
      'Emperor Wu of Liang asked Great Teacher Bodhidharma, (Even getting up at the crack of dawn, he never made a profit at the market.) "What is the highest meaning of the holy truths?" (For the time being turn to the secondary to ask.) Bodhidharma said, "Empty--there’s no holy." (Split his guts and gouges out his heart.) The emperor said, " Who are you facing me?" (He finds tusks in his nostrils.) Bodhidharma said, "Don’t know." (’If you see jowls from behind his head...’) The emperor didn’t understand.(A square peg doesn’t fit in a round hole.) Bodhidharma subsequently crossed the Yangtse River, came to Shaolin, and faced a wall for nine years.(A house with no surplus goods doesn’t prosper.)',
    commentBeforeVerse:
      'Prajnatara once instructed Bodhidharma, our great teacher, "Sixty-seven years after my death you will go to China to present the medicine of the great teaching, showing it directly to those of excellent faculties; be careful not to go too fast and wither under the sun. And when you get there, don’t stay in the South--there they only like fabricated merit and don’t see the inner reality of buddhahood, so even if you go there, you shouldn’t stay too long." And after all it turned out that he did travel to Liang (in the South), cross over into Wei (in the North), and remained unmoving for nine years. In recent times, when Cizhou’s robe and teaching were bequested to Renshan, Renshan said, " I am not such a man." Cizhou said, "Not being such a man, you do not afflict ’him’." Because of his deep sense of gratitude for the milk of the true teaching, Renshan raised his downcast eyes and accepted. Cizhou went on to say, " Now you are thus; most important, don’t appear in the world too readily--if you rush ahead and burst out flippantly, you’ll surely get stuck en route." This, Prajnatara’s three instructions, and Bodhidharma’s nine years of sitting, are all the same situation. Zhaxi’s verse says, Willing to endure the autumn frost, So the deep savor of the teaching will last, Even though caught alive, After all he is not lavishly praised. This is suitable as an admonition for those in the future. A genuine wayfarer knows for himself the time and season when he appears. Even though Emperor Wu did not comprehend, still he made a point with his question that can be dug into. Even now everywhere when they open the hall and trike the gavel they still say, "Assembly of dragons and elephants at the seat of the Dharma, behold the highest truth." But if it is the ultimate truth, can it after all be seen? Does it admit Emperor Wu’s questions or Bodhidharma’s answers? I say, leaving aside the highest meaning for the moment, what do you want with the holy truths? Tianhuang said, "Just end profane feelings--there is no special holy understanding." The Heroic March Scripture says, " If you create an understanding of holiness, you will succumb to all errors." Just this Bodhidharma, saying "Empty--there’s no holy," undeniably has expert skill and a discerning eye in the light of a spark or flash of lightning. Emperor Wu stayed there dribbling like a fool, not backing off; he went on to ask, "who are you who reply to me?" For Emperor Wu’s part, this was still a good intention, but he hardly realized that for Bodhidharma it was like being spit in the face. Bodhidharma couldn’t help but again offer an " I don’t know." Already this is a case of ’the beauty of the flowers easily fades away; how could you add frost to snow?’ Bodhidharma saw his eyes moving and immediately shifted his body and traveled another road. The ancients sometimes came forth, sometimes stayed put, sometimes were silent, sometimes spoke; all were doing buddha-work. Later Emperor Wu after all ’thought about a superior man after he had gone’ and personally wrote an epitaph for him, which said, I saw him without seeing, Met him without meeting him--Now as of old, I regret and lament this. Even though His Majesty was just an ordinary man, he presumed to consider Bodhidharma his teacher in retrospect. After Emperor Wu was covered with dust and Bodhidharma had returned to the West, since then no one has brought up the highest meaning of the truth; fortunately there is Tiantong, who brings it out for the people.',

      '    From this humans and divinities have made medicine and disease.(When an act of heaven has already passed, the emissary should know.)',
    commentAfterVerse:
      '"Empty--nothing holy; The approach is far off."The latter expression comes from Zhuangzi--"Very far off, not near to human sense." At that time the patriarch Bodhidharma may have been a bit lacking in expedient technique, but it is hardly realized that unless the medicine stuns you it won’t cure the disease. At first he immediately brought down a thunderous hand, but now he has already gone this way to take a rest; therefore ’succeeding , he swings the axe without harming the nose.’ As Zhuangzi was attending a funeral procession, as they passed the grave of Huisi he turned and said to his followers, "As Yingren was plastering a wall he splashed a bit on his nose, a spot as big as a fly wing; he had Jiangshi cut it off. Jiangshi swung his axe, creating a breeze, and cut it off with a whoosh--closing his eyes, letting his hand swing freely, he cut away the whole spot without injuring Yingren’s nose. Yingren stood there without flinching. Since the death of these people, I have no one capable of being my disciples." "Failing, he drops the pitcher without looking back." Mengmin of the latter Han dynasty stayed in Taiyuan during his travels; once as he was carrying a pitcher, it fell to the ground, but he went on without looking back. Guo Linzong saw this and asked him the meaning. Menmin replied, "The pitcher is already broken; what’s the use of looking back?" Linzong considered him unusual because of this, and urged him to travel for study. The meaning is that if Emperor Wu had spontaneously acquiesced, Bodhidharma would never have cramped himself to go along with another; if Emperor Wu was baffled, Bodhidharma could brush out his sleeves and immediately leave without regret. In the golden palace he showed his facelessness, managing to say a half; hanging his mouth up on the wall at Shaolin was only eighty percent. This is like " The clear moon of autumn turns its frosty disc." This indirectly makes use of Fayan’s poem, "Everywhere I go, the frosty night’s moon falls as it may into the valleys ahead," bringing to light the incomparable Way of ultimate truth. "The Milky Way thin, the Dipper hangs down its handle in the night." In a talk in the teaching hall, Tiantong has said, "In the spherical dot shines the uttermost subtlety; where wisdom is effortless, knowledge remains. When clinging thought is cleared away nothing else is left; in the middle of the night the Dipper handle hangs down in the Milky Way." These two verses are like a mute serving as a messenger--he points it out to people, but can’t express it. How could there be master to disciple transmission, mutual quelling of medicine and disease? This misses the point all the more. How is it possible to bring up the true imperative in its entirety? How much tortoise hair thread is used for the flowers in the sky? A stone woman uselessly raises the poison needle.(Tsk!)',

    title: 'CASE 3: THE INVITATION OF THE PATRIARCH TO EASTERN INDIA',
    image: '/images/cong-rong-lu/cong-rong-lu-cover.jpg',
    intro:
      'The state before the beginning of time--a turtle heads for the fire. The one phrase specially transmitted outside of doctrine--the lip of a mortar bears flowers. Now tell me, is there any ’accepting and upholding, reading and reciting’ in this?',
    main:
      'A rajah of an east Indian country invited the twenty-seventh Buddhist patriarch Prajnatara to a feast.(Over and over again he’ll be paying back the debt of his mouth) The rajah asked him, "Why don’t you read scriptures?" (Whoever receives a salary without service is uneasy in sleeping and eating) The patriarch said, " This poor wayfarer doesn’t dwell in the realms of the body or mind when breathing in, doesn’t get involved in myriad circumstances when breathing out--I always reiterate such a scripture, hundreds, thousands, millions of scrolls."(The preceding lecture and eulogy was an unlimited excellent cause.)',
    commentBeforeVerse:
      'The Twenty-Seventh Patriarch was first called Keyura as a boy. As it came to pass that the twenty-sixth patriarch Punyamitra was riding by in a chariot together with a king of eastern India, who was known as The Resolute, the patriarch asked the boy, "Can you remember things of the past?" The boy Keyura replied, " I remember that aeons ago I lived in the same place as you, Master; you were expounding mahaprajna, great wisdom, and I was upholding the most profound scripture; I have been awaiting you here to assist you in the true teaching." The patriarch said to the rajah, "This is not one of the lesser holy ones--this is a bodily reflection of Mahasthamaprapta, ’The One Who Has Arrived at Great Power.’" The rajah had the boy get into the chariot, took him to the palace and made offerings to him. When the boy put on monastic robes and had his head shaved, the patriarch drew on the connection with the prajna or Wisdom Scripture to have him named Prajnatara, ’Jewel of Wisdom.’ / ' +
      'The Liang Court took Bodhidharma to be Avalokitesvara, in India they considered his teacher Prajnatara to be Mahasthamaprapta--only Amitabha Buddha hasn’t come down here to earth so far.

Later, as it happened that the royal family provided for an assembly, the Honorable Prajnatara presided; this old fellow displayed wonders and fooled the crowd--at that time he should have been knocked over, to cut off the complications; if we wait for the question why the Honored One doesn’t read scriptures, after all it can’t be let go. An this old fellow Prajnatara had no signs of greatness, either; he took a gourd horse dipper and flipped it over once. The rajah bowed in respect at that--what does he know? I say, the king of a nation coveted one grain of another’s rice, the reverend lost ten thousand years’ provisions. He only knew his iron spine held up the sky--he didn’t realize his brain had fallen to the ground. If you want to help him up, only Tiantong can do it. / ',
    verse:
      'His verse says, A cloud rhino gazes at the moon, its light engulfing radiance;(He subtly puts a line through; the pattern is already evident.) A wood horse romps in spring, swift and unbridled.(Going through a cluster of hundreds of flowers, not a petal sticks to his body.) Under the eyebrows, a pair of cold blue eyes;(Never chased a bunch of snakes and ants) How can reading scriptures reach the piercing of oxhide? (Gone through) The clear mind produces vast aeons,(One arrow before the prehistoric buddhas.) Heroic power smashes the double enclosure.(...shoots through the double barrier.) In the subtle round mouth of the pivot turns the spiritual works. (When has it ever moved?) Hanshan forgot the road by which he came(Not being present for a while is like being the same as a dead man.)--Shide led him back by the hand.(This has to be a man of the same locality.)',
    commentAfterVerse:
      'The opening two lines eulogize ’not dwelling in the realms of body or mind, not involved in myriad circumstances.’ According to the analysis of the canonical teachings, five clusters (form, sensation, conception, conditioning, consciousness), twelve sense media (eye, form, ear, sound, nose, smell, tongue, taste, body, feel, mind, phenomena) and eighteen elements (twelve media plus six associated consciousnesses), are called three groups. The honored Prajnatara just brought up the head and tail, implicity including what’s in between. The Sanskrit word anapana is translated as breathing out and breathing in. There are six methods involved with this; counting, following, stopping, contemplating, returning, purification. The details are as in the great treatise on cessation and contemplation by the master of Tiantai. Those whose preparation is not sufficient should not fail to be acqainted with this. Guishan’s Admonitions says, " If you have not yet embraced the principles of the teachings, you have no basis to attain understanding of the mystic path." The Jewel Mine Treatise of Sengzhao is beautiful--"A priceless jewel is hidden within the pit of the clusters of being"--when will you find ’the spiritual light shining alone, far transcending the senses’? Tiantong says, "A cloud rhino gazes at the moon, its light engulfing radiance." In an ancient song it says that the rhino grew his horn while gazing at the pattern on the moon. Good words are to be treasured, but in the final analysis they tend towards feelings and thoughts based on literary content. "A wood horse romps in spring, swift and unbridled." This eulogizes "breathing out, not involved in myriad circumstances." One might say that skillful action has no tracks. "Under the eyebrows, a pair of cold blue eyes." Luopu said, "One who has only understood himself and has not yet clarified the eye of objective reality is someone who has only one eye." If you want both eyes to be perfectly clear, you must not dwell in the realms of the body or mind and not get involved in myriad circumstances. And to realize this you must ’hang sun and moon high in the shadowless forest, implicitly discern the spring and autumn on the budless branches.’ "How can reading scripture reach the piercing of oxhide?" Changqing said, "What fault is there in the eyes?" In the Heroic March Scripture it says, "Now as you look over this assembly of sages, using the eyes to look around, those eyes see everywhere just like a mirror, in which there is no special discrimination." If you miss it here, as Yaoshan said, " You must even pierce through oxhide." I say, after all he had the adamantine eye. " The clear mind produces vast aeons." The Third Patriarch said, "Just do not hate or love, and all will be clear." Even if one moment of thought is ten thousand years, this cannot be fully upheld. Lumen sadi, "The whole earth is a student’s volume of scripture, the whole world is a student’s eye; with this eye, read this scripture, for countless aeons without interruption." I say, it is not easy to read. "Heroic power smashes the double enclosure." During the latter Han dynasty Wangmang sent his brothers Wangxun and Wangyi to Kunyang, where they surrounded Guangwu with dozens of rows of soldiers. Guangwu’s army was weak and he wanted to surrender to Xun and Yi, but Yi refused; thereupon Guangwu made his generals more determined--they marshalled their troops out to fight back and routed Xun and Yi. The honorable Prajnatara was complete in both respects, cultural and military-out, he is a general; in, he is a minister. The elements of being, of body and mind, and the myriad circumstances, are more than a double enclosure. "In the subtle round mouth of the pivot turns the spiritual works." In the ancient classic Erya, the pivot is called the hinge-nest; Guopu’s annotation says that it is a doorhinge; flowing water doesn’t go stale, a door hinge is not worm-eaten--this means it is active. The Honored One acted before being directed, turned spontaneously without being pushed; whether on this side or that side, he was beyond right and wrong. Tiantong separates the sand, picks out the gold, distinguishes the marks and divides the ounces--he has judged the fine points. In the last two lines, he still has extra talent, and says, "When Hanshan forgot the road whence he came, Shide will lead him by the hand to return." This eulogizes the oceanic congregation of the national assembly boring through paper, piercing windows. The Honored One is so kind, he holds forth in brief; "lifting the blind to return the baby sparrow, from the papaer full of holes comes a silly fly." His use of Hanshan’s poem is like joining complementary tokens. The poem says, If you want a place to rest your body, Cold Mountain is good for long preservation. A subtle breeze blows in the dense pines; Heard from close by, the sound is even finer, Underneath the trees is a greying man, Furiously reading Taoist books. Ten years I couldn’t return--Now I’ve forgotten the road whence I came. "After Lu Qiuling came to call, he went back together with Shide; after going out the pine gate, he never returned to the monastery." One book says, "Volubly reading Taoist books." This versifies a child lost, forgetting how to return, and a lost man pointing the way. Emperor Zhuangzong of the latter Tang dynasty invited Chan Master Xiujing of Huayan temple into the palace for a feast. The great teachers and great worthies there were all reading scriptures; only masterXiujing’s group was silent. The emperor asked, "Why don’t you read scriptures?" Xiujing said, "When the way is easy, we don’t pass along the imperial command; during the halcyon days we stop singing the song of great peace." The emperor said, "For you not to read scriptures may be all right, master, but why don’t your followers read them either?" Xiujing said, "In a lion’s den there are no other kinds of animals; where the elephant walks there are no fox tracks." The emperor said, "Why do the Great Teachers and Great Worthies all read scriptures?" Xiujing said, "Jellyfish have no eyes--in seeking food they must depend on prawns." The emperor was delighted. At that, the honored patriarch Prajnatara has been called Mahasthamaprapta for long aeons, and because he recited the profoundest scripture he was named Prajnatara by his teacher, but really had not yet got rid of habit energy and was bested by that Xiujing, who after all has the nose of a patchrobe monk. At this point I uncousciuosly let out a laugh--what was I laughing at? Where the statues of Yunju bare their chests, When the pitchers of Gongxian close their mouths.',

It was also like when the Second Patriarch said nothing, whereupon Bodhidharma told him, "You have my marrow." Judging by this monk’s question about the ultimate meaning of the Buddhist teaching, he too was a true-blue newcomer to the monastery--he wants to travel around the iron enclosing mountains with Manjusri.

Zhizang said, "I have a headache today and can’t explain for you. Ask brother Hai."(’I shouldn’t be unable to be Master Ma’s disciple.) The monk asked Hai;(A bitter gourd is bitter to the root.)

      'The sixth Patriarch said to Master Huairang, "The Twenty-Seventh Patriarch of India foretold that from your disciples will emerge a young horse who will trample everyone in the land to death. The sickness is in your heart; don’t speak too quickly." Later Huairang polished a tile and beat an ox, and the spiritual horse entered the stable; he was called Mazu, Ancestor Ma (’horse’). He had the stride of an ox and the glare of a tiger. He could extend his tongue over his nose. On his soles were circular marks. One hundred and thirty-nine people succeeded to him in the Dharma, and each became a teaching master in one area. Zhizang and brother Hai were Xitang and Baizhang. When we look at this monk, he too is a student of Buddhism; he uses the four propositions and hundred negations to make sure of the source essence of the special transmission outside the teachings. the Mahayanasamgraha says, "’Existence’ is slander by exaggeration, ’nonexistence’ is slander by underestimation; ’both existence and nonexistence’ is slander by contradiction, and ’neither existence nor nonexistence’ is slander by intellectual fabrication." If you abandon these four propositions (of existence, nonexistence, both, or neither), the hundred negations are spontaneously wiped out. Huangbo said, "If you want to understand directly and immediately, everything is not it." I say, "If you understand clearly and thoroughly, nothing is not it." Looking at it the other way around, without abandoning the four propositions or the hundred negations, where is the meaning of living Buddhism not clear? The Great Master Nagarjuna said, "Wisdom is like a mass of fire--it cannot be entered from any side." Yet he also said, "Wisdom is like a clear cool pool, it can be entered from any side." This monk said, "Apart from the four propositions and beyond the hundred negations, please point out to me directly the meaning of living Buddhism." Everywhere they call this a question in the mouth of a shackle; but Mazu wasn’t flustered--he just said, "I’m too tired to tell you today. Go ask Zhizang." He spared his own eyebrows and pierced that monk’s nose; that monk did not escape being sent away--he really went and asked. Zhizang too fit in the groove without contrivance--"Why don’t you ask the teacher?" The monk didn’t open his eyes; he said, " The teacher told me to come ask you." Zhizang said, "I’ve got a headache today, I can’t explain for you. Go ask brother Hai." The monk asked Hai, who said, "When i come to this, after all I don’t understand." ’ I thought it was Houbai (the thief), but here is even Houhei (who robbed Houbai by trickery)." Although the monk didn’t have a sanguine nature, still he saw things through from start to finish--he told all this to Mazu, who said, "Zang’s head is white, Hai’s head is black." This statement kills everyone in the world with doubt. A verse of Zhaojue of Donglin says, The hundred negations and four propositions gone, wordless, Black and white distinctly clear, determining absolute and relative. I say ’four in the morning, three at night’--they are glad or mad without reason. One night as these three great men were gazing at the moon along with Nanquan, Mazu said, "What should one do at this very moment?" Baizhang said, "Just right to cultivate practice." Xitang said, "Just right to make offerings." Nanquan brushed out his sleeves and left. Mazu said, "The scriptures go into the treasury(zang); meditation goes into the ocean(hai)--only Nanquan alone transcends utterly beyond things." Even here black and white should be clearly distinguished. I say, ’Zang’s head is white, Hai’s head is black’--a duck’s head is green, a crane’s head is red. The ten-shadowed spiritual horse stands south of the ocean, the five-colored auspicious unicorn walks north of the sky. People everywhere, do not depend on a fox spirit--Tiantong has the real story.',
    verse:
      'His verse says, Medicine working as illness(A babarian drinks milk and then is suspicious of a good doctor.)--It is mirrored in the past sages. (When the teachers are many, the lineage is confused.) Illness working as medicine(Digesting medicine with medicine, eliminating poison by poison.)--Sure, but who is it?(Isn’t it Tiantong?) White head, black head--capable heirs of the house. (Cooked with one steaming.)Statement or no statement--the ability to cut off the flow. (He renews Guishan’s laughter.) Clearly sitting cutting off the road of speech, (Once dead you don’t live again.) Laughable is the old ancient awl at Vaisadi.(He just got one part.)',
    commentAfterVerse:
      'The four propositions as four repudiations are like ’a mass of fire which cannot be entered from any side’--the four propositions as four gates are like ’a pure cool pool which can be entered from any side.’ When I was scribe at Daming in the old days, Master Heng of Tanshi passed through Daming; I knocked on the door in the dark of night, calling his attendant, burned incense and formed a relationship--then Tanshi allowed me to see him. I asked him to tell me more about what is the living word and what is the dead word. He said, "Scribe, if you understand the dead word, it is the living word; if you don’t understand the living word, then it is the dead word." At that time I thought to myself that the methods of an old adept would after all be different. Now looking at this monk’s question today, he stayed anchored, demanding to have the living meaning pointed out apart from the four propositions and beyond the hundred negations. The three old fellows’brains resembled one another--if you immediately understand as abandoning the four propositions and transcending the hundred negations, you will be buried in the same pit with this monk. Later Tiantong eulogized Yangshan’s dream about striking the gavel: "Abandon the four propositions, cut off the hundred negations--in sickness Master Ma and his children stopped doctoring." I say, what mental activity is this?" "White head, black head--capable heirs of the house." In the Book of Changes, under the diagram ’covering’ it says, "Capable heirs of the house are able to uphold the family work." "Statement or no statement--the ability to cut off the flow." I say, he has only ripples on still water, no waves flooding the heavens. "Clearly sitting cutting off the road of speech, laughable is the old ancient awl at Vaisali." The Sanskrit name of Vaisali means ’vast adornment’ in translation--this is the name of the city where Vimalakirti lived. Manjusri asked Vimalakirti about the real way to nonduality, and Vimalakirti remained silent; when this monk questioned father Mazu and his sons, elaborations covered the earth. Tell me, what is it that is laughable? ’If you can just avoid the taboo name of the present, you’ll purpass the eloquence of a former dynasty, which cut off every tongue.’',

    main:
      'Yaoshan hadn’t ascended the seat (to lecture) for a long time.(Movement isn’t as good as stillness.) The temple superintendent said to him, "Everybody’s been wanting instruction for a long time--please, Master, expound the Teaching for the congregation."(He relies on the heavy, not the light.) Yaoshan had him ring the bell; when the congregation had gathered, (Gathering together acting as ministers, what matter could be troublesome?) Yaoshan ascended the seat: after a while he got right back down from the seat and returned to his room. (That’s something to talk about!)The superintendent followed after him and asked, "A while ago you agreed to expound the Teaching for the congregation. Why didn’t you utter a single word?" (If the ocean were filled, the hundred rivers would have to flow backwards.) Yaoshan said, "For scriptures there are teachers of scriptures, for the treatises there are teachers of treatises. How can you question this old monk?"(Too bad--a dragon’s head but a snake’s tail.)',
    commentBeforeVerse:
      'The hungry will eat anything, the thirsty will drink anything. Therefore at five requests from three people bodhisattvas enter the teaching hall, showing their whole bodies with half a verse; demigods take the high seat--how could they begrudge the teaching? Chan Master Huinan of Huanglong said, "Nowadays many people take the Dharma lightly; I would be like a farmer who lets the fields dry from time to time to make them parched and thirsty--after that, when water is poured on, then the crops sprout." When Yaoshan did not take the high seat for a long time, however, it was not like this. Jiaofan said, "A hut conceals deep within a thunderous tongue; let the myriad forms explain on their own." Yongjia said, "Speaking when silent, silent when speaking; the gate of great generosity opens, with nothing blocking the way." The administrator missed every point; he said, "The community has been wanting some instruction for a long time--please expound the teaching for them." In the course of humanity and duty, in the capacity of host and guest, this is not out of line--so Yaoshan had him ring the bell. He only saw the thunderous issue of the command; when the congregation gathered, how could they know the stars would blaze with glory? Yaoshan took the high seat, remained silent, then after awhile got down and returned to the abbot’s room--this act of supernormal power is not the same as the litle ones. The superinendent monk followed behind and asked, " A while ago you agreed to expound the teaching for the congregation--why didn’t you utter a single word?" Cuiyan Zhi said, " When Yaoshan got down from the seat, at first the superintendent wondered why he didn’t say a single word--this could be called misleading his three armies." I say, it’s just that the general is not valiant. Yaoshan said, "For scriptures there are teachers of scriptures; for the treatises there are teachers of treatises. How can you doubt this old monk?" Langya Jiao said, "When Yaoshan got down form the seat, doubt was unavoidable; when he was confronted by the superintendent, he lost one eye." I say, how many could recover completely? Yet he doesn’t know how to get back two eyes. Xuedou said, "What a pity that old fellow Yaoshan bit the dust on even ground; no one in the world can help him up." I say, you too should lend a hand. Wuyu’s verse said, He had already bit the dust before leaving his room; Quietly he returns, with no further mistake. Teachers of scriptures and treatises still tell each other; When one fact is distinctly clear he’ll call them himself. I say, government officials are easily tested, but the public case is not complete. Giving it to Tiantong, how will he judge?',
    verse:
      'A foolish child troubles over ’money’ used to stop crying.(What’s the use?) A good steed chases the wind, looking back at the shadow of the whip.(He gets right up and goes.) Clounds sweep the eternal sky; nesting in the moon, the crane(An embarrassment for the one under the tree.)--The cold clarity gets into his bones, he can’t go to sleep.(Dreaming with open eyes.)',
    commentAfterVerse:
      'In the Great Demise Scripture it says when a child cries its mother takes yellow leaves and says, ’I’ll give you some gold,’ whereupon the child stops crying. The first line versifies "We have been wishing for some instruction for a long time; why didn’t you utter a single word?" An outsider asked the Buddha, "I don’t ask about the spoken or the unspoken." The World Honored One remained silent; the outsider then bowed and said, "The World Honored One’s great compassion has opened the clouds of my illusion and allowed me to gain insight." After the outsider had left, Ananda asked the Buddha, "What truth did he see that he said he had gained insight?" The Buddha said, "Like a good horse, he goes as soon as he sees the shadow of the whip." Yaoshan and the World Honored One raised the whip alike; the superintendent led the assembly of monks--there is something to praise. Yet he wondered why Yaoshan didn’t say anything--we might say that patchrobed monks in China are not as good as outsiders in India. Tiantong’s versification in this way and my explanation in this way are all yellow leaves to stop crying. It is just because you are sound asleep and not yet awakened. Those whose sleep is light will wake up as soon as they’re called; those deep asleep can only be roused by shaking them. There is yet another kind who, when you grab them and stand them up like dead trees they still talk in their sleep by themselves, staring. Compared to that Yaoshan, a crane nesting in the clear moon, so clear he can’t sleep, the difference is as between clouds and mud. But even so, his sleep talk is not little.',

One day he didn’t leave; (Been doubting this guy all along.) Baizhang then asked him, "Who is it standing there?"(Things can’t be mixed up--when a guest comes you should wait on him.) The old man said, "In antiquity, in the time of the ancient Buddha Kasyapa, I lived on this mountain.(Originally he is a man of the house.) A student asked, ’Does a greatly cultivated man still fall into cause and effect or not?"(Just do good, don’t ask about the road ahead.)

(Buried in one pit.) The old man was greatly enlightened at these words.(Fox drool is still there.)',
    commentBeforeVerse:
      'On Baizhang Mountain in Hong prefecture, every time Chan Master Dazhi ascended the high seat, there was always an old man listening to his teaching. The old man had dwelt on this mountain in the time of Kasyapa Buddha; because he had answered a student mistakenly, up to the present he had degenerated into a wild fox being. Indeed it was because he himself leaned on a fence and stuck to a wall, sending people off to fall into a pit and plunge into a ditch. He saw Dazhi had the skill to pull out nails and draw out pegs, so he forsook himself and followed the other, asking Dazhi wo turn a word in his behalf. Dazhi gave a fearless explanation, lightly turning and saying, "He is not blind to cause and effect." The old man was greatly enlightened at these words. He based his logic on actuality; not falling into cause and effect is finding the wondrous along with the flow. Those who understand the vehicle of the teachings see immediately when this is brought up, but though they shed their hair clothes, they’re still wearing scale armor. Have you not heard it told how when Chan Master Yuan was in the assembly of Chan Master Hui he heard two monks bring up this story; one monk said, "Even if he’s not blind to cause and effect, he still hasn’t shed the wild fox body." The other monk replied, "Just this is not falling into cause and effect--and when has he ever fallen into cause and effect?" The master was startled and considered these words unusual; he hurried to the bamboo cluster hermitage on Mount Huangbo--as he crossed a valley stream he was suddenly enlightened. He saw Master Nan and told what happened; before he finished tears were streaming over his jaws. Master Nan made him sleep soundly on the attendants’bench; but suddenly he got up and wrote a verse: Not falling, not blind; For monks or layfolk there are no taboos. The bearings of a freeman is like a king’s--How can he accept the enclosure of a bag or covering by a lid? One staff can be horizontal or vertical--The wild fox leaps into the company of the golden lion. Master Nan laughed. Seeing it in this way, when we first see him say, "I now ask you to turn a word for me," hopefully he would have said, "He does not fall into cause and effect," to avoid causing beginners to fall into the pit of understanding. In the evening Baizhang went into the hall and recounted the preceding events; Huangbo immediately asked, "An ancient answered a turning word mistakenly and fell into a wild fox body for five hundred lives; what if one is not mistaken, turn after turn?" Baizhang said, "Come here and I’ll tell you." Huangbo approached and gave Baizhang a slap; Baizhang clapped his hands laughing and said, "I knew foxes’ beards were red--here’s another red-beard fox!" Yangshan said, "Baizhang attained the great capacity, Huangbo attained the great function." They didn’t have the names for no reason; Guishan asked Yangshan, "Huangbo always uses this capacity--did he get it by birth or from another?" Yangshan said, "This is both his receiving a teacher’s bequest and also inherent communion with the source." Guishan said, "So it is." Look at the father Baizhang and son--they roam fearlessly like lion kings--how could they make a living in a wild fox den? My tail bone is already showing more and more--now I’ll let Tiantong loose to ply his claws and fangs. Look!',

As before entering a nest of complications.(wrapping around the waist, entangling the legs.) Ah, ha! ha!(Laughable, pitiable.) Understand?(He holds the cow’s head to make it eat grass.) If you are clear and free,(Like insects chewing wood...) There’s no objection to my babble.(...happening to make a pattern.)

      'Establishing practice and realization, distinguishing cause and effect--a foot of water, a fathom of wave. Falling into the spirit of a wild fox for five hundred lives--even if the two monks at the bamboo cluster hermitage had extrordinary discernment, when we hold them up to examination, they have not avoided plunging into a tangle. In this line of Tiantong’s there are two characters which do not rest easy--why doesn’t he say, "As before they plunge into a wild fox liar"? "Ah, ha! ha!" This illustrates Baizhang’s enlighenment: Tiantong reveals what’s in his own heart, saying, "Understand?" But I ask, does Tiantong understand? "If you are clear and free, there’s no objection to my babble." Fortunately he has status--what chore would he not do for others? Babble, "dada wawa," is baby talk--representing that it is not real speech. Also the Weir of Interpretation of the Lotus of Reality says, "dada is a symbol of learning action; wawa is a symbol of learning speech." In the Great Demise Scripture there is ’sickness practice’ and ’baby practice.’ Some book say ’baba wawa.’ Chan Master Shandao of Shishi said, "Among the sixteen practices in the Great Demise, the baby practice is best." All this is the same meaning as the "spirit songs and shrine dances." But tell me, what is the harmony?

    commentBeforeVerse:
      'Chan Master Yuantong Xiu of Fayun saw two monks standing together talking; he took his staff, went up to them and hit the ground several times with the staff and said, "A piece of karmic ground." How much the more so in the case of the leaders of the groups in the two halls, who got into an argument over a cat; Nanquan didn’t offer them forgiveness or encouragement, nor did he give them admonition and punishment--a genuine man of the Way, he used the fundamental matter to help people; holding up the cat, he said, "If you can say a word I won’t cut it." At that moment all sentient and inanimate beings in the whole universe are alike in Nanquan’s hands begging for their lives. At that point, if there had been someone who came forward and either extended open hands or else grabbed him by the chest and held him tight and said, "After all, we sympathize with the Master’s spiritual work," even if Nanquan had specially carried out the true imperative, I dare say(that person) would have been able to save the cat. But this den of dead rats had no energy at all; once Nanquan held forth, he wouldn’t withdraw, and acted out the order to the full. Eminent Xin of the Liao dynasty wrote the Mirror Mind Collection, in which he criticizes Nanquan’s group for killing a living being, committing wrongdoing. Head Monk Wen wrote Discerning Errors in the ’Inexhaustible Lamp’ in which he helped (Nanquan) out, saying, "An ancient text has it that he just made the gesture of cutting--how could he have simply cut it in two with one stroke, sending fresh blood gushing?" In these two critiques of the ancient, Mr. Wen’s fault is the graver, whereas Mr. Xin’s fault is the lesser. As ever, Nanquan was shaking his head and wagging his tail in a herd of water buffalo. Haven’t you read how as Chan Master Fori was having tea with his group he saw a cat coming and tossed a dove from his sleeve, giving it to the cat, which took it and went away. Fori said, "Excellent!" This too cannot be false contrivance of empty action. Nanquan thought to himself that ’where the tune is lofty, few join in’--reciting the preceding story to Zhaozhou he questioned him about it, whereupon Zhaozhou took off his sandals, put them on his head, and went out. After all, drumming and singing go together; clapping the interval was accomplished perfectly--Nanquan said, "If you had been here you could have saved the cat." Although this little bit of activity is difficult to understand, yet it is easy to see--just see through it in lifting the spoon and picking up chopsticks, and you will see that the cutting of the cat and the wearing of the sandals on the head are not any different. Otherwise, look again; what tricks has Tiantong specially created?',
    verse:
      'The monks of both halls were all arguing; (If you have a reason, it’s not a matter of shouting.) Old Teacher Nanquan was able to show up true and false.(The clear mirror on its stand, when things come they’re reflected in it.) Cutting through with a sharp knife, all oblivious of formalities, (How much wind of the Dragon King does it take?) For a thousand ages he makes people admire an adept.(There is one who doesn’t agree.) This path has not perished(What use can the head of a dead cat be put to?)--A connoisseur is to be lauded.(I don’t say there are none, just that they’re few.) In tunneling through mountains to let the sea pass through, only Great Yu is honored:(The effort is not misspent.) In smelting rock and mending the sky, only Guonu is considered best.(It won’t do to lack one.) Old Zhaozhou had a life: (Picking up whatever comes to hand, there’s nothing that’s not it.)Wearing sandals on his head, he attains a bit.(For the moment I believe a half.) Coming in differences, still clearly mirroring; (A wearer of the patch robe is hard to fool.) Only this real gold is not mixed with sand.(This is truly impossible to destroy.)',
    commentAfterVerse:
      '"All the monks of both halls were arguing"--up till now they have never settled their controversy. If not for Tiantong understanding how Nanquan’s example evinces the whole from a clue, time and again the mistaken and the correct would not be distinguished. When the false and the true are distinct, how do you judge them? Then you should cut them off with a sharp sword and bury them in one pit. This will not only put an end to a whole lifetime’s unfinished business, it will also cause the breeze to be pure throughout the land for a thousand ages. At Nanquan’s the teacher was excellent, the apprentice strong; seeing the group had nothing to say, he recounted it to Zhaozhou, to show that there was a man in the crowd. Zhaozhou took off his sandals, put them on his head and walked out--after all "this path has not perished--a connoisseur is to be lauded." Confucius said, "Heaven is not about to destroy this culture." Observe how the paths of teacher and apprentice merged, singing and clapping following along with each other; nothing can compare. In the method for making illustrative posthumous names it says that the flowing through of the fountainhead of the spring is called Yu. Also being the beneficiary of abdication and accomplishing good works is called Yu. In the classic geography The Contributions of King Yu, it says, "He led the river from Rock Mass Mountain to Dragon Gate Gorge." According to the book of Huainan, "The army of the Gonggong clan was strong and violent, and they contended with king Yao; when their strength was exhausted they ran up against the Buzhou Mountains and died. Because of this the pillar of heaven broke; the goddess Guonu smelted five-color stones to repair the sky." Liezi says, "When the positive and negative principles lose balance, that is called ’lack’--smelting the essence of the five constants is called repairing." Master Ben of Yungai brought up the story of Dongshan taking away the fruit tray from the head monk Tai and said, "Though Dongshan has the mallet to shatter the void, still he doesn’t have the needle and thread to mend it." Nanquan is like great Yu, who dug through the montains to let the sea pass through, manifesting extraordinary actions: Zhaozhou is like Guonu smelting stones to repair the sky; he finished the story. I say, Zhaozhou was able to break up the home and scatter the family eighteen times; I don’t know how many lives he had. Wearing sandals on his head amounts to something--tsk! tsk! there’s nowhere to go, acting this way. Baofu Congzhan said, "Even though he’s right, it’s just worn-out sandals; Nanquan leveled the high and spoke to the low--’If you had been here, you could have saved the cat.’" Cuiyan Zhi said, "Even the great Zhaozhou could only save himself." He passed up the first move. Tiantong said, "Coming in differences, still clearly mirroring; only this real gold is not mixed with sand." He only can push the boat along with the stream; he doesn’t know how to steer against the wind. And now this bunch of you are here, and we have no cat; what dog shall we argue over? Wansong chased them out with his staff.',

Zhaozhou asked the same question and the woman answered in the same way. Some immediately talk about them as two parts, (saying that) the first time this monk was helping the woman, and that later the woman was helping Zhaozhou. Only Xuanjiao has said, "The preceding monk questioned and was answered in this way and later Zhaozhou also questioned and was answered in this way; but tell me, where was the examination?" I say, ’seen through.’ He also said, "She was not only seen through by Zhaozhou, she was also seen through by this monk." i say, not only has she gotten Xuanjiao involved, but me too. Langya said, "Even the great Zhaozhou walked into the woman’s hands and lost his life. Even so, many misunderstand." I say, don’t judge others by yourself. Muzhe of Daguishan said, "All the monks in the world only know to ask the way from the woman; they don’t know the depth of the mud right under their feet. If not for old Zhaozhou, how could the heights of attainment of the sweating horses be revealed?" Even so, we need to borrow Tiantong’s eulogy to do it.',
    verse:
      'His verse says, Old in years, attaining the essence, no mistake in transmission(Just don’t bedevil people’s sons and daughters.)--The Ancient Buddha Zhaozhou succeeded to Nanquan.(Zhen province truly produces big turnips.) The dead tortoise loses its life due to designs drawn on it;(Subtle ghosts and spirits are after all caught in the net.) Even the steeds ’Chariot’ and ’Wind-chaser’ are encumbered by halter and bridle.(Even ’Running Wind’ and ’Galloping Rain’ cannot avoid the halter.) Having checked out the woman’s Chan, (How many men are manly?) Told to people, it’s not worth a cent.(Obviously the faculties are not those of a sage.)',
    commentAfterVerse:
      'Ghosts and spirits attain their essence by weird powers. Spells and drugs form their essence of dependent powers. Divinities and dragons attain their essence by earned powers. Buddhas and Patriarchs attain their essence by the power of the Way. Nanquan and Zhaozhou were people beyond buddhas and patriarchs--how could they grow old? That is why it says, " Old in years, attaining the essence." The enlightened master Zhaozhou succeeded to Nanquan. Mazu said, "The Scriputures are in Zhizang, meditation rests with Huaihai--only Nanquan is alone transcendent beyond things." Zhaozhou was a companion of Changsha; Nanquan was their teacher. Therefore his discerning examinations are not to be classified or characterized in terms of gain or loss, victory or defeat--everyone calls this the Pass of Zhaozhou; it is unavoidably difficult to get through. However, Confucius had a saying, "A spirit turtle can manifest a dream in an accomplished sorceress, but can’t avoid the entrapment of the rapacious net; its knowledge is capable of seventy-two auguries without making any wrong divinations, yet it cannot escape the calamity of having its guts rent. Being so, that means its knowlege wears out at some point, there is an extent to which its spirit cannot reach." Zhuangzi said, "The sorceress Song dreamed of a man covered with hair who said, ’I am from the depths of the sovereign road; I was the officer in charge of clearing the rivers for the lord of rivers; a fisherman got me along with his catch.’ Later when she awoke she figured it out: it was a spirit turtle--it turned out that a fisherman had actually netted a white turtle, five feet around, along with his catch. The sorceress wanted to revive it; she divined on it and said, ’Killing the turtle augurs good fortune.’ So she hollowed out the turtle and drilled auguring holes in it seventy-two times without any mistaken divinations." That’s what Confucius was referring to. Luopu said, "If you want to know the ever-transcending people, they do not stick the words of buddhas or patriarchs on their foreheads--that would be like a turtle bearing a design, by which it brings on itself the sign of losing life, like a phoenix ensnared in a golden net, heading for the sky--how can it hope to get there?" King Mu of Zhou dynasty had eight swift steeds, among which were two who mounted the clouds and galloped off, soaring beyond the birds in flight--therefore they were called ’Swift Four Horse Chariot’ and ’Wind-chaser.’ This part of the verse describes the woman being able to see through the monk and yet not avoiding Zhaozhou’s examination. Although Zhaozhou can see through, still he doesn’t avoid Langya’s check. In intensive meditation this is called the law of gold and manure: if you don’t undrestand, it’s like gold; when you see through it, it’s like manure. That is why it says, "Told to people, it’s not worth a cent." You just leave behind emotional calculations of gain and loss, victory and defeat, and you’ll naturally always fool the woman and look down on Zhaozhou. But if you come to my door, don’t point to yourself while carrying a board.',

    intro:
      'A bodyless man suffers illness; a handless man compounds medicine; a mouthless man ingests it; a senseless man is well. But tell me, how do you treat a mortal disease?',
    main:
      'Great Master Yunmen said, "When the light does not penetrate freely, there are two kinds of sickness.(Do you feel your mouth dry up and your tongue shrivel?) One is when all places are not clear and there is something before you.(Seeing ghosts in broad daylight--isn’t it an illusion?) Having penetrated the emptiness of all things, subtly it seems like there is something--this too is the light not penetrating freely. (It’s already gripped your chest--why bother to shut your throat?) Also, the Dharma-body has two kinds of sickness:(Disaters don’t happen alone.) one is when you manage to reach the Dharma-body, but because your clinging to Dharma is not forgotten, you sense of self still remains, and you fall into the realm of the Dharma-body.(Not only false idols, even a close relative.) Even if you can pass through, if you let go, that won’t do.(Nursing sickness, the body dies.) Examining carefully, to think ’What breath is there?"--this too is sickness.."(Before the doctor has left the house, convulsions break out.)',
    commentBeforeVerse:
      'Master Jianfeng of Yuezhou was a successor of Dongshan Wuben. While he was traveling around, Yunmen saw this teacher, as well as Caoshan and Sushan. This public case came from a preceding one: Jianfeng said to his congregation, "The Dharma-body has three kinds of illness and two kinds of light; you must pass through them all one by one and realize furthermore that there is stll a opening going beyond." Yunmen came forward from the assembly and said, "Why does the man inside the hermitage not know what is outside the hermitage?" Jianfeng laughed aloud; Yunmen said, "This is still what the student doubts." JIanfeng said, "What is going on in your mind?" Yunmen said, "I want the teacher to comprehend thoroughly." Jianfeng said, "Only thus can one sit in peace." Yunmen said, "Yes, yes." Jianfeng said the Dharma-body has three kinds of illness, Yunmen said the Dharma-body has two kinds of illness. When I was traveling, everywhere they were discussing this, saying that the three illnesses are ’going away before arrival,’ ’attachment after arrival,’ and ’penetrating through having no basis to rely on.’ Now the two illnesses spoken of here just omit going away before arrival; the latter two are clearly much the same. Master Foyan said, "Searching for a donkey while riding on a donkey is one illness; after getting on the donkey, not being willing to get down is also an illness." This just omits the last kind. Teachers give prescriptions in accordance with the disease for a certain time, each employing appropriate techniques. The two kinds of light and the two kinds of illness when the light doesn’t penetrate freely are no different. Now as for ’when everywhere is not illumined and there is something in front of you is one illness,’ Dongshan said, "Clearly she sees her face--there is no other reality; but unavoidably she mistakes the reflection for the head." If you have the eye to settle heaven and earth and are most thoroughgoing, without letting so much as a thread slip out, only then will you attain somewhat. Also he said, ’penetrating the emptiness of all things, subtly there seems to be something; this too is because the light does not penetrate freely.’ As Guishan said, "When there is nothing that can strike the feelings, the view is still in the objective." The Heroic March Scripture says, "Even if you extinguish all perception and discernment and keep to inner hidden tranquility, this is still a reflection of discrimination of conceptual objects." Nanyuan Huiyong said, "Before, I was like walking in the light of a lamp." Thus it is said, ’this too is the light not penetrating freely.’ According to the fundamental way of the Dongshan succession, if you’re still, you sink into stagnant water, if you move, you are limited to the present. Thus, when going outward do not react; when going inward, do not dwell in emptiness. Outwardly not pursuing ramifications, inwardly not abiding in trance, naturally you will get beyond the three sicknesses and two lights all at once. After that, putting penetrating or not penetrating to one side, examine carefully: ’what breath is there?’--this too is an illness. How can you rest easy? Ask Tiantong to take your pulse.',

    commentAfterVerse:
      '    He says, The dense web of myriad forms is so precipitous;(Let them be--how can they hinder you? If you know them, they’re not enemies.) Passing through beyond location blocks the eyes.(Adding a flapper to a flail.) Sweeping out his garden--who has the strength?(Sweeping away tracks makes traces--the more you hide, the more it’s revealed.) Hidden in a person’s heart, it naturally produces feelings.(Suspicion in the mind makes ghosts in the dark.) A boat crosses a rustic ford, wet with autumn’s aquamarine,(Submerged in stagnant water.) Sailing into the reed flowers shining on the snow, bright.(The stationary bank misleads people.) With a bolt of silk, an old fisherman takes it to market;(He puts down his capital, hoping for profit.) Floating in the wind, a single leaf travels on the waves.(Finding the wonder along with the flow.) / ' +
      '    The Statements of Truth Scripture says, "The myriad forms and multitude of appearances are the impressions of a single truth." The one is many, the many are one; that is this, nothing else. Let them be high and precipitous, an enormous mass; one does not pull weeds in a wild field. The clear ground after all misleads people--even if you can pass through beyond location, this is just what blocks the eye. The Complete Enlightenment Scripture says, "Illusory states of mind are not annihilated, either." Dongshan said, "The peasant sadly cuts the spiritual roots of the auspicious grass." Why sweep the garden and empty all things? When Yumen said, "When everywhere is not clear and there is someting before you, this is one sickness," he was not telling you to get rid of illusory objects, annihilate illusory mind, and seek some other place of transcendence. The Third Patriarch said, "The six senses are not bad--instead they are the same as true enlightenment." Together with the Complete Enlightenment Scripture’s "Knowing illusion, one is detached; without employing any technique one detaches from illusions, without any process; then one sees doing, stopping, letting be, and extinction," it is like rubbing the back of a clay mannikin with diamond. Tiantong also said, "Hidden in a person’s heart, it naturally produces feelings." This versifies ’subtly it seems like something is there.’ This is precisely the subtle four kinds of illness described in the Complete Enlightenment Scripture: "Knowing self, aware of self, subtly continuing, like life." That is why Puque said, "the great compassionate World Honored One quickly explained the illnesses of meditation." "A boat crosses a rustic ford, wet with autumn’s aquamarine." This versifies reaching the Dharma-body, mooring the boat on the deep still waters of the clear source: Sushan called the Dharma-body a dead wood post-this is real donkey-tethering stake. Even if you get as far as setting the boat in motion, still you can’t avoid rowing into the brightness of the white reed flowers reflecting the snow. At this point, "Even though the pure light shines in your eyes, it seems you have missed your home; even turning around in pure clarity, after all you get bogged down in that state." This versifies ’Even if you can penetrate, it won’t do to let it go.’ Here Yunmen has said it all ,Tiantong has versified thoroughly. Afterwards it is necessary to see Yunmen’s essential meaning and Tiantong’s eye; here is where the gain or loss is figured. What is Yunmen’s essential meaning? Didn’t you see how he said, "Examining carefully, ’what breath is there?’--this too is an illness." Yunmen just points out the sickness but doesn’t tell how to cure it. What is Tiantong’s eye? He tells Yunmen’s cure: "With a bolt of silk, an old fisherman takes it to market; floating in the wind, a single leaf travels on the waves." Yunmen’s meaning is entering the market place extending his hands, not avoiding the wind and waves: it could be said that with his own sickness cured, he pities others’sickness. This is the heart of Vimalakirti. But do you know? With many sicknesses you learn about medicine, but only if you get results may you dare to pass on the prescription. / ',

    commentBeforeVerse:
      'Chan Master Guichen of Lohan temple in Zhang province was previously asked by the governor of Zhang province to dwell in the Dizang temple, built by the governor in the Rocky Mountains west of Min City. After a year there the Master moved to Lohan. Therefore he is also called Dizang. The master of Xiushan joined with Fayan, Wudong, and the master of Jinshan, to travel beyond the lake region(of east central China). Coming to Zhang province, they were blocked by rain, snow, and swollen valley streams. They put up at Dizang temple west of the city. There they encircled the brazier and ignored master Dizang. Dizang wanted to test them, so he also drew near the fire and said, "There’s something I would ask about; may I?" Xiushan said, "If there’s some matter, please ask." Dizang said, "Are the mountains , rivers, and earth identical or separate from you elders?" Xiushan said, "Separate." Dizang held up two fingers; Xiushan hurriedly said, "Identical! Identical!" Dizang again held up two fingers, and then left. Fayan said, "What was the meaning of the abbot holding up two fingers?" Xiushan said, " He did that arbitrarily." Fayan said, "Don’t crudely insult him." Xiushan said, "Are there any elephant tusks in a rat’s mouth?" The next day they took leave and departed; first they went to the house. Fayan said, "You brothers go ahead; I’ll stay with Dizang--he may have some strong point. If not, I’ll come find you." After Fayan had studied there for a long tiem, the other three, including Xiushan, also came back to Dizang. Subsequently Dizang asked, "How’s the Buddhism in the South these days?" At that point they just should have said, "Always the same as here," but instead (Xiushan) said, "There’s a lot of discussion going on." He doesn’t even know how to come forth on his own. Dizang said, "How can that compare to me here planting the fields and eating rice?" At that moment Xiushan should have said, "If so, then it is not just the South," but instead he said, "How about the world?" Dragging in the meditating travelers of the South, his mundane air was not yet gone. Out of compassion Dizang had a discussion in the weeds, saying, "What do you call the world?" It would have been better just to say, "I’m busy planting the fields," so to avoid Tiantong listing his crime on the same indictment.',
    verse:
      'Source and explanation variously are all made up;(Today there’s no expedient.) Passing to ear from mouth, it comes apart.(Monks, don’t think it strange.) Planting fields, making rice--ordinary household matters;(Couldn’t be anything else.) Only those who have investigated to the full would know(Why want to know?)--Having investigated to the full, you clearly know there’s nothing to seek:(You should still ask for more instruction from Tiantong once.) Zifang after all didn’t care to be enfeoffed as a marquis;(This is still a sacred tortoise dragging its tail.) Forgetting his state he returned, same as fish and birds,(Finding the wonder along with the flow.) Washing his feet in the Canglang, the hazy waters of autumn.(The use of it is inexhaustible.)',
    commentAfterVerse:
      'Qingliang said, "Communion with the source is one’s own practice; communion by speech is showing it to those who are not yet enlightened." It originally comes from the Scripture on the Descent of the Great Vehicle into Lanka; the Buddha said to Mahamati, "There are two kinds of communion; communion with the source means by way of the character of transcending progress one attains to utterly detach from false conceptions from speech and symbols, and go to the realm of nonindulgence; by the process of self-awakening, light shines forth--this is called the character of communion with the source. What is the character of communion by speech? It means teaching the various inductive doctrines of the nine branches, avoiding signs of difference or nondifference, existence or nonexistence, and the like, using skillful techniques to explain the truth as it is needed. This is the character of communion by speech." Students of lecturers say, "Communion by speech without communion with the source is like the sun being hidden by clouds. Communion with the source without communion by speech is like a snake gone into a bamboo tube. Communion with the source and communion by speech together is like the sun in the open sky. Communion neither with the source nor by speech is like a dog howling in a thicket of reeds." If we distinguish the source and speech, these already are two pathways; how can Chan be divided into five branches and the teachings arranged in three vehicles? Here in not even one can stand up--all are artificial. How much the more so is going out the mouth into the ear, asking for instruction, reciting and eulogizing--the vines of entanglements and complications have extended into the next county already. The teapots of Gongxian are not without hot water. It is not just in the South that there is a lot of debate going on--if you are someone who can speak of fire without burning your mouth, your eloquence is like a torrent, but basically there’s not so much as a letter. Even though planting the fields and making rice is ordinary, unless you investigate to the full you don’t know their import. The ancients would reap and boil chestnuts and rice at the edge of a hoe, in a broken-legged pot, deep in the mountains--their fortune was no more than contentment; all their lives they never sought from anyone. Their nobility was no more than purity and serenity--what need for bushels of emblems? Thus, "Having investigated to the full, you clearly know there’s nothing to seek: Zifang after all didn’t care to be enfeoffed as a marquis." According to the Historical Records, in the sixth year of the Han dynasty they enfeoffed meritorious ministers; some said Zhang Liang had never achieved anything in war. The emperor said, "Setting forth plans in the tent to decide victory beyond a thousand miles is Zifang’s (Zhang Liang’s) achievement." Then the emperor had him choose thirty thousand households in Qi for himself. Liang said, "I first served in Lower Pei, where I met a deity in Liu City--this was given to your majesty by heaven through me; using my plans, fortunately the time was right. I wish to be enfeoffed with Liu City, that’s enough--I cannot presume to take over thirty thousand households." This verse means it’s not necessary to open a hall and expound the teaching as in the South. Leaving the clamor, going by way of a fisherman’s song, When the waters of Canglang are clear, I can wash my tassels. When the waters of Canglang are muddy, I can wash my feet. This is the common ground of monkeys and cranes, where birds and fish both roam. But tell me, who is this person? A true boardbearer.',

Guishan said, "How many people are there in the fields?"(Just two, father and son.)Yangshan planted his hoe in the ground, clasped his hands and stood there.(His letting go is a bit precipitous.) Guishan said, "On South Mountain there are a lot of people cutting thatch."(He beats the grass to roust the snakes.) Yangshan took up his hoe and went.(His gathering back is too fast.)',
    commentBeforeVerse:
      'Teacher and apprentice join ways, father and son complement each other’s actions; the family style of Gui and Yang is a guide for a thousand ages. Guishan asked Yangshan, "Where are you coming from?" Could Guishan not have known Yangshan had come from the fields? He was just using this question to have a meeting with Yangshan. Yangshan didn’t turn away from the question put to him simply saying this: "From the fields." Now tell me, is there any Buddhist principle here or not? Guishan entered deeply into the tiger’s cave, going on to ask, "How many people are there in the fields?" Yangshan planted his hoe in the ground and stood with clasped hands, immediately meeting as a patchrobe monk. Xuansha said, "If I had seen him then, I would have kicked over the hoe for him." I say, he can’t control his zeal. Chan Master Touzi Yiqing said in verse, Few really understand the point of Guishan’s questions; When Yangshan answered him by planting the hoe, Buddhas and Patriarchs disappeared. Xuansha, kicking it over, as a bystander doesn’t agree, To avoid letting the blue yellow green deepen with spring. I say, when the grass is withered, the hawk’s eye is swift. The verse of Chan Master Ping of Falun Temple on Nanyue says, Meeting on a narrow road, escape is impossible; When planting the hoe, standing with folded hands, Having come across the Bridge, he walks on the shore, For the first time realizing his whole body is muddy and wet. I say, not worth looking around in the light of the moon. The versification of these two old adepts(Touzi and Ping) only have the thousand-foot cold pine; look again-Tiantong lets out and draws forth a stalagmite.',
    verse:
      'The verse says, The old enlightened one’s feelings are many; he thinks of his descendants.(Too doting.) Now he repents of setting up a household.(For thirty years there’s been no lack of salt and vinegar.) We must remember the saying about South Mountain(Noble people forget much.)--Engraved on the bones, inscribed on the skin, together requiting the blessing.(The bitter feeling is not given up.)',
    commentAfterVerse:
      'This verse is like the biography of Maoying in the Book of the Han Dynasty; ’real and conventional come up together.’ When you take a look, Guishan is the old enlightened one; Yangshan and his successors are his descendants. If you go into it, then it’s not so. A monk asked Tiger Cen of Changsha, "Does the original man attain buddhahood?" Cen said, "You tell me--does the emperor of China cut thatch?" Thus we know that cutting thatch is the business of the minister. "But now he repents of setting up a household." A thousand-year shadowless tree, the bottomless shoe of the present; abiding master of the moon over the thousand peaks, robe and bowl, a valley and clouds. All these are empowered descendants inheriting the family work. Thus we know that ’lord and minister, father and son," as a teaching device, was not particularly first established by Dongshan and Caoshan; father and son Gui and Yang had already carried out this order. If not for Guishan thoroughly checking, Yangshan would have just reeked of gruel and rice in the gate of shadows of a light, ahead of an ass but behind a horse, taking this as his ordinary life--that would have been most regrettable. Therefore Tiantong instructs, "We must remember the saying about South Mountain--engraved on the bones, inscribed on the skin, together requiting the blessing." Fadeng said, "The old peasants return with bundles of firewood, urging their wives to spin through the night. See how busy they are at home; but tell me, by whom are they empowered? When you ask them, they don’t know, and suddenly give rise to doubt and confusion. Ah, how many people past or present know the virtue of gratitude?" How is it after they know of it? Cutting off an arm without feeling pain, standing in the snow without getting weary. That is why since I’ve grown old I have lived here in this Temple of Requiting Blessings.',
